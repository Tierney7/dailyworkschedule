## Description
In this project my motivation was to create a user friendly daily planner. This tool will be useful in helping those utilize the most of their time during the work day. 

## Installation 
My goals for this project were to create a daily planner. Create a header using jumbotron to display my title, and the current date. The planner is for work hours 9am-5pm. Each hour having its own row displaying time, space to enter a task, and the ability to save to local storage. Using CSS to set the color and creating classes of past, present, and future in javascript we set each to less, equal, or more than. All past hours are given a dark gray back-ground color. All present hours with red, and all future hours with blue.
